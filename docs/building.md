# Building

You must have a 64-bit machine for building and running the project. Always
run your system updater before building and make sure you have the latest
drivers.

## Setup

### Windows

* Windows 10 or later
* [Visual Studio 2022 or 2026](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
* CMake 3.10+ (or C++ CMake tools for Windows)
* Windows 11 SDK version 10.0.22000.0 (for Visual Studio 2022, this or any newer version)
* [Python 3.6+ 64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Ensure Python is in PATH.
* [Vulkan SDK](https://sdk.lunarg.com/sdk/download/latest/windows/vulkan-sdk.exe)
  * The build script will automatically detect it if installed at `C:\VulkanSDK`
* Qt 6.10.1 (for the UI)
  * Install using aqtinstall:
    ```
    pip install aqtinstall
    python -m aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.10.1 win64_msvc2022_64 -m qtmultimedia -O C:\Qt
    # Note: msvc2022_64 is compatible with with VS2026
    ```
  * The build script will automatically detect it if installed in `C:\Qt`

#### Cross-compiling (Windows ARM64 ↔ x64)

The build supports cross-compiling between Windows x64 and ARM64 on the same
machine. The host and target Qt installs are kept in separate trees under
`C:\Qt\<version>\` and `xb` configures into `build-<target>/` so it never
clobbers the native-build tree.

* Install Visual Studio components for the target architecture:
  * x64 host targeting ARM64: **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ ARM64/ARM64EC build tools**
  * ARM64 host targeting x64: **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools**
* Install both Qt flavors via aqtinstall. Qt 6.10.1 renamed the host-runnable
  `qmake.bat` / `qtpaths.bat` shims to `host-qmake.bat` / `host-qtpaths.bat`;
  aqtinstall ≤3.3.0 still looks for the old names and fails at the patch step,
  leaving the install tree un-stitched ([aqtinstall#998](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/issues/998)).
  Install aqt from master until the fix ([PR #952](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/pull/952))
  lands in a tagged release:
  ```
  python -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall.git
  ```
* From an **x64 host** targeting ARM64, install both the x64 Qt (for host
  moc/rcc and the windeployqt tool) and the ARM64 "cross_compiled" Qt (for
  target libs + the `.bat` shims that redirect host tools at the target):
  ```
  python -m aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.10.1 win64_msvc2022_64 -m qtmultimedia -O C:\Qt
  python -m aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.10.1 win64_msvc2022_arm64_cross_compiled -m qtmultimedia -O C:\Qt
  ```
  Then:
  ```
  xb build --target-arch arm64 --config=release
  ```
  Output lands in `build-arm64\bin\Windows\Release\`.
* From an **ARM64 host** targeting x64, install both the ARM64 "cross_compiled"
  Qt (the host tree — aqt does not offer a separate native ARM64 flavor) and
  the x64 Qt (for target libs; its tools run under Prism emulation):
  ```
  python -m aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.10.1 win64_msvc2022_arm64_cross_compiled -m qtmultimedia -O C:\Qt
  python -m aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.10.1 win64_msvc2022_64 -m qtmultimedia -O C:\Qt
  ```
  Then:
  ```
  xb build --target-arch x64 --config=release
  ```
  Output lands in `build-x64\bin\Windows\Release\`.

#### Debugging

VS behaves oddly with the debug paths. Open the 'xenia-app' project properties
and set the 'Command' to `$(SolutionDir)$(TargetPath)` and the
'Working Directory' to `$(SolutionDir)..\..`. You can specify flags and
the file to run in the 'Command Arguments' field (or use `--flagfile=flags.txt`).

By default logs are written to a file with the name of the executable. You can
override this with `--log_file=log.txt`.

If running under Visual Studio and you want to look at the JIT'ed code
(available around 0xA0000000) you should pass `--emit_source_annotations` to
get helpful spacers/movs in the disassembly.

### Linux

Linux support is extremely experimental and presently incomplete.

The build script uses Clang 21. GCC while it should work in theory, is not easily
interchangeable right now.

* Normal building via `xb build` uses CMake+Ninja.
* Environment variables:
  Name  | Default Value
  ----- | -------------
  `CC`  | `clang`
  `CXX` | `clang++`

<!--* [CodeLite](https://codelite.org) is supported. `xb devenv` will generate a workspace and attempt to open it. Your distribution's version may be out of date so check their website.
* Experimental CMake generation is available to facilitate use of other IDEs such as [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/). If `clion` is available inside `$PATH`, `xb devenv` will start it. Otherwise `build/CMakeLists.txt` needs to be generated by invoking `xb premake --devenv=cmake` manually.-->

Clang-19 or newer should be available from system repositories on all up to date distributions.
You will also need some development libraries. To get them on an Ubuntu system:

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential mesa-vulkan-drivers valgrind libc++-dev libc++abi-dev liblz4-dev libsdl2-dev libvulkan-dev libx11-xcb-dev clang-19 llvm-19 ninja-build libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-cursor0
```

In addition, you will need up to date Vulkan libraries and drivers for your hardware, which most distributions have in their standard repositories nowadays.

**Qt 6.10.1 (for the UI)**

You can install Qt from your distribution's package manager, or use aqtinstall:

```sh
pip install aqtinstall
aqt install-qt linux desktop 6.10.1 linux_gcc_64 -m qtmultimedia -O /opt/Qt
```

If using aqtinstall, add Qt to your environment:

```sh
export PATH="/opt/Qt/6.10.1/gcc_64/bin:$PATH"
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/Qt/6.10.1/gcc_64"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/Qt/6.10.1/gcc_64/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
export QT_DIR="/opt/Qt/6.10.1/gcc_64"
```

## Running

To make life easier you can set the program startup arguments in your IDE to something like `--log_file=stdout /path/to/Default.xex` to log to console rather than a file and start up the emulator right away.
